# Kotlin Basics

This repository is made in the context of learning media both for the owner himself and for the public.

This project was generated using gradle. What needs to be considered is only the contents of the source code, so there is no need to build the project.

The source code itself only contains everything that the owner understands, which of course is very limited. If you feel the need to get more detailed information about the code, it is highly recommended to visit the official Kotlin website.

Thank you and let's learn together.
